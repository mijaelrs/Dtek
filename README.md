Pointers, memory and list
We were tasked to create a c-program that could handle memory correctly when retrieving data from lists through different 
data structures. As we know, memory handling in C is manual. My partner and I divided the work, but we worked closely together
and helped each other put together the whole program. Everything marked Marie Kindblom is what she wrote, the rest is me.
